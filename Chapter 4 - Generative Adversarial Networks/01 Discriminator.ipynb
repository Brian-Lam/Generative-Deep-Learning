    "## Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (or GANs) are neural networks that contain two components: The Generator and the Discrinator. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the GAN receives an original dataset of genuine data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The generator takes in random noise and tries to turn them into observations that look like they were from the original dataset. The discriminator, on the other hand, takes in observations and tries to predict whether they are from the original dataset or if it was a \"forgery\" created by the generator. This create-and-evaluate process is used to create better forgeries from the generator, and likewise for the discriminator to get better at identifying forgeries. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more practical terms:\n",
    "* A original dataset may contain images of cats\n",
    "* The generator is passed in random noise as an input, and tries to turn that noise into cat images (\"forgeries\")\n",
    "* The discriminator tries to determine whether the image was real or forged\n",
    "* The generator and the discriminator both get better at their jobs"
